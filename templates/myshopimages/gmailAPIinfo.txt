Q &  A======+++++++++++=============
1:11 PM 7/27/2017
I have an HTML file that reads the next event in my calendar using this Google Calendar API javascript . (https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/js).

It works correctly as described in the above link by manually inserting http://localhost:8000/quickstart.html in a browser address window with a python webserver running locally and I can see it makes a GET request in the Python server window. The events are printed to the same browser window. I have the quickstart.html file in the Python 3 directory.

The question is how to run it (or the scripts inside) automatically from my menu.html page which refreshes once a minute with the time and date and print the event in the menu?

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. This is a small internal system all running on the same Windows 7 PC so there are no security worries in case that's an issue. Thanks, Phil

ans...If the code you are talking about runs on page load you could add
setInterval(function(){ location.reload(); }, 6000);
to your javascript or
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="60">
to your HTML either will refresh the page the page every 60 seconds automatically and thus run your code again.


ans...I think I may have found a solution with iFrames. <iframe src="localhost:8000/readcalendar.html"; align="left" frameborder="0"> </iframe> � Phil Jun 14 '16 at 21:54

ans...That is an ok solution. as I don't have access to your code to see how it runs I would also consider looking into 'jquery load'. � Jinjubei Jun 15 '16 at 15:04
